### Writing Functions ###

# Write a function "compare_length" that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"


# Pass two vectors of different length to your "compare_length" function


# Write a function "describe_difference" that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"


# Pass two vectors to your "describe_difference" function


### Bonus ###

# Rewrite your "describe_difference" function to tell you the name of the vector which is longer
