### Subsetting vectors ###

# Create a vector "x" that the numbers 5,2,6,2,1,7


# Create a vector "y" that has the numbers 2,3


# Create a vector "z" by adding "x" and "y" (note the recycling!)


# Create a vector "first_three" that has the first three elements of "z" in it


# Create a vector "small" that has the values of "z" that are less than 5


# Create a vector "large" that has the values of "x" that are greater than or equal to 5


### Bonus ###

# Replace the values in "z" that are larger than 5 with the number 5


# Replace every other value in "z" with the number 0
